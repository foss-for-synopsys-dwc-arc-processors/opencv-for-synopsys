This is a patched version of OpenCV/2.4.9 compatible with EV6x Family of Processors

 -  Download OpenCV from [GitHub location](https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/opencv-for-synopsys)
 -  Set `OCV_HOME` variable to point to that repository
 
 on Linux bash:
 ```sh
        $ export OCV_HOME=<path_to_opencv/opencv-for-synopsys>        
        $ ls $OCV_HOME 
```
 on Windows:

```sh
        $ set OCV_HOME=<path_to_opencv/opencv-for-synopsys>        
        $ dir %OCV_HOME% 
```
